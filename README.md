# :pencil: Challenge Overview

This challenge is of intermediate difficulty and involves creating a function called mumble that manipulates a given string according to specific rules. The function should repeat each character in the string a number of times equal to its position in the string, with each repeated section separated by a hyphen. This challenge tests string manipulation skills and loop comprehension.

## :white_check_mark: Solution Overview

My solution for the 13-mumble challenge involves iterating through the input string and repeating each character based on its position in the string. I achieved this by using a loop to iterate through each character, appending the character repeated (i + 1) times to a result string and separating each repeated section with a hyphen, except for the last one.
